## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, I acquired skills in creating an accordion using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned to structure HTML for the accordion, style it with CSS, and implement interactivity through JavaScript. Additionally, I focused on accessibility considerations, incorporating ARIA attributes. This project enhanced my understanding of web development and the seamless integration of these technologies to build dynamic user interfaces.
